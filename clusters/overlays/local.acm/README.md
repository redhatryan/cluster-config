#### Home (local) Cluster

This is my home cluster which runs on a server under my desk and uses the highly original cluster name of 'home'. It runs in libvirt on a Ryzen 3900x server with 128 GB of memory. It is typically configured as three combined master/worker nodes with 7 vCPU and 35 GB per node.
